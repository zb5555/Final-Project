#IT 1000 fro Zach Brasier throughout the semester.

At the beginning of the semester I was totally uneducated on all the different types of code and was intimidated by this class in general. 
I did my best to try to pick up the different techniques and skills throughout the semester. 
I was never totally sold on IT as my major so I was hesitant towards the class and major in general at the beginning.
