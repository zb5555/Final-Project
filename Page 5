#This is the last page of the Final Project.

This is the last page of the project, as of right now I still need to figure out how to get pages 2-5 to read the code The way the main page does
but I will figure it out I'm sure. I'm pretty sure that it costs 7$ a month to create pages so I will not be doing that.
